Welcome to my Github repo. If you're reading this, it's probably because you found a link on my resume, not because I have an awesome solution to your special problem.. I host my personal projects here and they're a pretty good way to learn about my attitude & style as concerns programming.

Some interesting projects include:

## Java Stuff
[Klonk](https://github.com/zaboople/klonk): A wacky text editor that I use every day. I know yours is better, but yours isn't actually yours. Mine is really mine. Uses Java Swing but includes native executable generation for OSX & MS Windows.

[Tmplz](https://github.com/zaboople/tmplz): This is a templating engine. You can use it for HTML, or Javascript/CSS/SQL/Whatever texty thing you gots to do.

[Pdfrpt](https://github.com/zaboople/pdfrpt): An attempt to make the iText PDF library a little bit simpler, more concise, more "fluent", and generally less painful to work with. Intended for generating data-based reports with automatic paging and relative positioning.

## Other stuff
[bin](https://github.com/zaboople/bin): This is how I share my personal shell scripts between home & work. I don't think they're all that great but that's that.

[techknow](https://github.com/zaboople/techknow): I often spend hours trying to find out how to do something only to discover it's really "easy" inasmuch as you know the magic words. I keep track of my magic words here.
